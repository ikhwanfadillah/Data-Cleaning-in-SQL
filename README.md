# Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset. But it is crucial to establish a template for your data cleaning process so you know you are doing it the right way every time.


There are many benefits to having clean data:
1. It removes major errors and inconsistencies that are inevitable when multiple sources of data are being pulled into one dataset.
2. Using tools to clean up data will make everyone on your team more efficient as youâ€™ll be able to quickly get what you need from the data available to you.
3. Fewer errors means happier customers and fewer frustrated employees.
4. It allows you to map different data functions, and better understand what your data is intended to do, and learn where it is coming from.
