# Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset. But it is crucial to establish a template for your data cleaning process so you know you are doing it the right way every time.


There are many benefits to having clean data:
1. It greatly improves your decision-making capabilities.

      Data that is cleaned and that has high quality can support better analytics and business intelligence. Consequently, this can ensure better decision making and execution towards objectives. This is one of the most significant benefits of a implementing a sophisticated data cleansing process
2. It drives faster customer acquisition.

      Businesses can significantly boost their customer acquisition efforts by ensuring they have high quality data. This can be accomplished through an effective data cleansing strategy. For example, by cleaning data and ensuring it is accurate, a business can be far more efficient at acquiring new customers and even re-targeting past customers
3. It saves valuable resources.

      Removing duplicate and inaccurate data from databases can help business save valuable resources. These resources include both storage space and processing time. Duplicate and inaccurate data can significantly drain an organisationâ€™s resources, especially if the organisation is highly data centric. Cleaning and scrubbing data after it is captured can be very time consuming and expensive without the proper tools and processes to do it efficiently.
4. It can increase revenue

      In business, effective processes are very important. Spending a lot of time cleaning data can be very expensive. Businesses that work on improving the quality of their data through an effective data cleaning strategy can drastically improve their response rates to customers. Consequently, this leads to more productivity, happier customers, and much better decisions.
